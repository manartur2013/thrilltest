### Good Levels to Play

MAP TR1A0  - Very first map, where you are tasked with performing an experiment using Portal device

MAP TR1A2  - Cold war era offices. Lots of Zombies.

MAP TR1A3A - Laser corridor and gat gun turrets. Vent climbing and encounters with the military.

MAP	TR2A5  - Surface level with a lot of neat looking buildings.

The following maps TR3A1, TR3A2 and TR3A2A all have monster that shoots laser projectiles at you called Steven. Be sure to dodge his projectiles in time or you may turn into a smoking pile of dust!

### Characters

Snapbug - A huge alien insect that has no interest in you whatsoever. The only instance when it can hurt you is when you wander into its teeth by mistake. Very useful if you lure some headcrabs towards it.  
Panthereye - Or the Diablo. One of the most dangerous creatures that you may encounter. Very subtle creature, and its attacks are very rapid and deadly.  
Mr.Friendly - Huge, ugly creature that barely travels around. Don't be fooled by its clumsy movements, though, because it can kill you in one punch! God knows what it will do to your carcass afterwards!  

### Weapons
- 9mm Glock: Weak rapid-fire gun, useful against early game enemies.
- .44 caliber Python: Slow-firing but very accurate weapon that deals some heavy punch. Note the delay between each shot.
- Crossbow: Your only sniper weapon. Fires slow but deadly projectiles, so aim carefully!

### Power-ups

- Adrenaline: brings your back to life. Doesnt work if you fall from a cliff, though.
- Antitoxine shot: Cures poisonings, neutralizes acid. 
- Antiradine: Saves from radiation poisoning (it lasts for 50 seconds otherwise).
